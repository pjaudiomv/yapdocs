There is a sequence of precedence as follows. You can always validate the setting by going to the settings in the admin portal. 1) Querystring parameters that match the name. For example if you wanted to override the title for one page you'd do the following: index.php?title=something+here 2) Session overrides. This means the entire call will use this setting. index.php?override_title=something+here. Twilio will respect this setting for entire during of the call. 3) New Yap 3.0 Service body overrides from the Admin UI. These have a cascading hierarchy of precedence based off the service body above it in the hierarchy tree from your root server. Either the override_service_body_id (which will affect call routing) or override_service_body_config_id will pull these settings into the session for use. 4) Config.php. Any setting is controllable from within config.php. 5) Factory defaults. You can review them on your /admin/settings.php page. You can completely override any config.php file setting as well with additional precedence. 1) Create a new file called config_something.php. Add whichever settings you want to override. You do not need every setting, only those you want to override. 2) Use the last part after the underscore in your webhook as, for example: https://your-yap-server/index.php?override_config=something.","keywords":""},{"title":"Merging Yap Servers","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"blog/merging-yap-post","content":"Since Yap 3.0.0 (released in March 2019), it’s been possible to use a single Yap server with multiple Twilio accounts. What this means is that a service body can handle the overhead of server management while another service body retains the management of phone numbers and billing. Yap 3 also introduced the concept of configuration precedence https://github.com/bmlt-enabled/yap/wiki/Configuration-Precedence. This creates the ability to manifest all kinds of powerful capability without requiring access to the config.php on the server (critical for this situation where server management is handled by someone else). It also has the ability to set a value at regional level while the hierarchy of the BMLT automatically cascades down to the member areas. Recently I had to migrate my regional yap server to the zonal server. Below is the process I followed, feel free to send an email to help@bmlt.app if you’d like more details. Consider whether you may want to take a backup and overwrite your existing Yap database, or make a copy with a new install and config to do side by side testing. You may also want to consider setting in the database config ahead of time or afterward. You may also want to transfer any other settings in your top level config.php to the Config settings in the admin portal. Keep in mind that service bodies will use the hierarchy, so if you set this as a regional level all the service bodies connected will inherit them. 1) Delete any configuration from the target yap server, use the server body IDs that would be the IDs that would be the query below: DELETE FROM config where service_body_id in (x [,x]); Copy 2) Begin an export from your source yap server, select only data and exclude the flags table. See the screenshot below. (Use a self-contained file) 3) After the file has been exported run the below on your system. In the below example, “export.sql” is the file exported from Step 2 above. cat export.sql | sed -e “s/([0-9]*,/(NULL,/g” &gt; export-mod.sql Copy 4) Import export-mod.sql into the target yap server. “export-mod.sql” is the output from the command run locally in Step 3 above. 5) Your phone numbers must have explicit service body overrides in order to pull configuration values from the database (you can use either override_service_body_id or override_service_body_config_id). One changes your service body for call routing and the other selects configuration, respectively.","keywords":""},{"title":"Location Lookup Bias","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"general/location-lookup-bias","content":"Location Lookup Bias By default location lookups are biased toward the US. You can create a series of refinements by using the $location_lookup_bias in config.php. For example say you wanted to lookup Bayonne. By default Bayonne, New Jersey would be interpreted.

This is required by Twilio. Create a new virtual application or add the yap code to an existing folder. You can always find the latest stable version here (be sure download the yap-x-x-x.zip file and not the source code): https://github.com/bmlt-enabled/yap/releases/latest. You can also try out or help test the latest bleeding edge features by installing one of the unreleased versions. The newest version would always be the highest numbered build. Once the application is configured you will need to customize the config.php file. There are several settings there that are documented in that file. There are a number of different ways to utilize the yap platform. You will need to (config.php) enter $twilio_account_sid and $twilio_auth_token. You can find this on your account dashboard. You can also use a different Twilio account using the admin portal under &quot;Service Bodies&quot;. Keep in mind that if a key or keys are set at any parent above, all child service bodies will inherit that key. In order to use a key, just specify override_service_body_id in your webhook with the applicable id. You will need to ensure that the following config.php parameters are set. They should be a service body admin that will be responsible for reading and writing data back to your BMLT. This will not work with the &quot;Server Administrator&quot; account.

Specify this in config.php as the value for $google_maps_api_key. Make sure you have &quot;Google Maps Geocoding API&quot; and &quot;Google Maps Time Zone API&quot; enabled on your credentials. This key must be separate from your BMLT key with no server restrictions, this is safe because yap never passes the key client side. You can login into your Google API console here: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/. This article may be useful https://bmlt.app/google-maps-api-keys-and-geolocation-issues/. Try testing that your application actually is functioning properly by opening a browser http://example.com/index.php. You will need to set up a Twilio account, and do the following. Purchase a phone number (typically you would buy one for your locale, tollfree is pretty much unnecessary these days). Configure that number to point to a Webook. It would be something like https://example.com/index.php. Version 3.x You will need to set up a new MySQL database. Be sure to set up backups on your database as well. Your hosting provider may cover this more.

This will also run MySQL scripts to initialize/update your database. Make a call to your number and try it out. If there is a problem the debugger in the Twilio console will let you know why.
